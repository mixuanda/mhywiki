# HomDGCat Wiki Mirror

A complete offline mirror of [homdgcat.wiki](https://homdgcat.wiki), covering characters, weapons, artifacts/relics and more from Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail.

No-code update guide (Chinese): [`NON_TECH_GUIDE.zh-CN.md`](NON_TECH_GUIDE.zh-CN.md)
Local visual backend launcher: `start_local_backend.command`

## Contents

- 15,357 files, ~2.5 GB
- 575+ pages (Genshin + Star Rail characters/weapons/artifacts, etc.)
- 4,580+ dynamic subpages (quests, items, monsters, GCG cards, etc.)
- Data files in 5 languages (CH / EN / JP / KR / RU)
- All image assets (avatars, skill icons, weapon art, gacha art, etc.)
- TextMap localization data

## Quick Start

### Get Site Data

The site data (`site/` directory, ~2.5 GB) is not included in this repository. Three ways to obtain it:

**Option 1: Download from GitHub Releases (Recommended)**

Download `site.7z` from the [latest release](https://github.com/NewbieXvwu/HomDGCat/releases) and extract it to the project root:

```bash
# Download (~2 GB)
curl -LO https://github.com/NewbieXvwu/HomDGCat/releases/download/initial/site.7z

# Extract (requires 7-Zip)
7z x site.7z
```

**Option 2: Download from Internet Archive**

If GitHub is unavailable, download from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/homdgcat-wiki-mirror):

```bash
ia download homdgcat-wiki-mirror site.7z
7z x site.7z
```

**Option 3: Pull from the source site**

Download all files directly from homdgcat.wiki (may fail if the source site is unstable):

```bash
# Default (10 threads)
python main.py download

# 16 threads
python main.py download --workers 16

# Check progress
python main.py status
```

The script reads file paths from `filelist.txt` and downloads all missing files into `site/`. Existing files are skipped automatically; supports resuming interrupted downloads.

### Browse Locally

```bash
# Default port 9000
python main.py serve

# Custom port
python main.py serve --port 3000
```

Open `http://localhost:9000` in your browser to browse the full site.

### Full-Site Visual CMS (CH+EN)

```bash
# Recommended: start site + CMS together
./start_local_backend.command
```

- Admin: `http://localhost:9000/__admin`
- Preview: `http://localhost:9000/index/`
- Three-pane workflow: source tree / record list / editor
- Two edit modes: field editor + raw JSON editor
- Auto backups at `easy_updates/entity_backups/`
- Supports rollback, diff preview, and cross-source search

### TextMap Sharding (Recommended)

For better Git/manageability of large TextMap files:

```bash
# One-time split into 64 shards each
python3 scripts/textmap_shards.py init

# Rebuild GI.json/SR.json from shards
python3 scripts/textmap_shards.py rebuild
```

Double-click alternatives:

- `init_textmap_shards.command`
- `rebuild_textmap_from_shards.command`

## Server Engines

The script supports two server engines and auto-detects availability:

### stdlib mode (zero dependencies)

Works out of the box with no third-party packages. Based on Python's `http.server`:

- HTTP/1.1 + keep-alive
- Multi-threaded request handling
- gzip compression (with LRU cache)
- ETag / 304 conditional requests
- Tiered Cache-Control headers

Suitable for personal local browsing.

### ASGI mode (recommended)

Auto-enabled when dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install starlette hypercorn h2
```

## Repo Slimming Strategy

- Code repository and content directory are separated: `site/` is treated as local content, not main code history.
- Packaging still uses `make_release_package.command` to create `releases/site_*.zip`.
- Packaging also appends checksums to `releases/SHA256SUMS.txt`.

Based on hypercorn + starlette:

- Async I/O, far better concurrency than threading
- HTTP/2 support (requires TLS certificate)
- Production-grade connection management and timeouts
- gzip compression + ETag / 304
- Path traversal protection

Enable HTTPS + HTTP/2:

```bash
python main.py serve --cert cert.pem --key key.pem
```

## File Structure

```
main.py               # Unified tool script (download / serve / status)
filelist.txt         # Complete file list (15,357 entries)
site/                # Site files directory
  index/             # Homepage
  sr/char/           # Star Rail character pages
  gi/char/           # Genshin character pages
  data/{CH,EN,...}/  # Star Rail multi-language data
  gi/{CH,EN,...}/    # Genshin multi-language data
  images/            # Star Rail image assets
  homdgcat-res/      # Genshin image assets
  TextMap/           # TextMap localization data
```
